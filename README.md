# TopologyRuleMustBeCoveredByEndpointOfPoint
 In this rule the points in the input layer must be covered by the ends of lines in coverage layer, 
 so points errors are created on the points that are not covered by the ends of lines. 
 For example, this rule is useful when is needed that street intersections must be covered by the endpoints of street centerlines.
